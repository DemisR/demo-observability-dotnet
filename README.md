# Test

Got to react front http://localhost:3005
Cool! We can bet on our favorite footbal team.

`...Something went wrong`

ðŸ˜• It seems that sometimes bets don't work.


Developers should try to fix the bug. 
But how can they know where search?
They only know that "sometimes" doesn't work.

ðŸš€ The power of observabily tools help them

They start from [Sentry](https://sentry.io/organizations/demo-lm/issues/?project=5563890) and found the user issue.
They found an error when the user bet and the betting system respond to the call with an error code 500.

Now look in the logs with [Loki](http://localhost:3000/explore?orgId=1&left=%5B%22now-15m%22,%22now%22,%22Loki%22,%7B%22expr%22:%22%7Bcompose_service%3D%5C%22dotnetservice%5C%22%7D%20%7C~%20%5C%22500%5C%22%22%7D%5D)
and serach code 500 : `{compose_service="dotnetservice"} |~ "500"`
Click on the log and open the trace
